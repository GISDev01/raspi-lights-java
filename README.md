# Use a Raspberry Pi to control lights through a web app
This app (includes frontend and backend) will allow you to use a RasPi Zero W (or 3) to control a set of relays, which will control the Christmas lights turning on and off. This will allow anyone on the LAN to use this web app to turn the lights on and off. 

The state (on/off) for each relay is stored persistently in a relational DB.
